# Curatix

“It’s a platform that automatically collects content from different sources like blogs, RSS feeds, or social channels, 
organises it intelligently, and lets users curate or publish their own digest.”

“This system allows users to connect different content sources—like RSS feeds, blogs, or social accounts. The platform 
automatically fetches new content on a schedule, analyses it to detect topics or tags, stores it, and lets users filter,
search, or create curated collections.
